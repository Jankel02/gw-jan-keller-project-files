# Gesture-controlled events
These project files showcase the work I did as part of my bachelors paper.

Inside, you can find:
- The full Unreal Engine project files
- The full TouchDesigner project files
- parts of the TouchDesigner mediapipe plugin that are necessary for this project (created by Torin Blankensmith and Dom Scott. Please look at the original here: https://github.com/torinmb/mediapipe-touchdesigner/tree/canonical-face-mapping)

## TouchDesigner
In TouchDesigner, everything is relatively straightforward. You need to be actively running the TouchDesigner file in order for the full setup to work. You might have to change the input camera of the mediapipe node.
If you are experiencing difficulties with this, just download the mediapipe plugin yourself and replace the nodes with the downloaded ones.
I also highly encourage to check out the mediapipe plugin page in general, these guys did an amazing job and deserve credit.

 You might want to make sure the MediaPipe tox is externalised as described on their page.

## Unreal Engine
The UE files consist of my work with the gesture project (folder: own), as well as environmental work by Luca Morré, who provided the Star Wars inspired scenery (https://www.artstation.com/luca_morre).

These files are not optimised.

The startup map is the map the final test for my paper was conducted in. This one should be plug-and-play. The folders that hold files that are interesting to play around with have been colored for easier visibility.
